        Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Siddharth, a frontend engineer based in India. I
        specialize in crafting applications and automation scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worked as a Frontend Engineer at Everlytics developing analytical
        dashboards powered by machine learning for various clients.
        Additionally, I automated various tasks within the work environment. As
        a hobbyist, I enjoy building games, apps, scripts, and have even dabbled
        in creating a modded driver for my laptop.
